#Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition for Elderly In-Patients with a Luong Self-Attention Network

This repository contains code for the paper "Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition for Elderly In-Patients with a Luong Self-Attention Network", accepted at the IEEE/ACM Conference on Connected Health Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (2021), Washington DC (2021).

We introduce Luong Self-Attention Layers into the baseline Sensor-Based HAR model [DeepConvLSTM](https://github.com/STRCWearlab/DeepConvLSTM).
